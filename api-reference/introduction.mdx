<Note>
  The Runchat API allows you to use Runchat as a backend for other third party applications. The API is used by integrations like our Rhino and Grasshopper plugin.

## Welcome

The Runchat API allows you to run Runchats on arbitrary schedules, post data to Webhook nodes or trigger a workflow by providing inputs to specific parameters. 
The `Schema` endpoint allows you to retrieve an array of published parameter IDs for a given Runchat. You can then map over input parameter IDs to create the required inputs array for the `Run` endpoint.

## Authentication

The Runchat API uses keys to authenticate requests to the API on behalf of your runchat user profile and account. 
Runchat API keys can only be used to authenticate requests to endpoints, and cannot be used to download or access any information about your user profile or account. 
However, we still recommend you keep these keys secure and cycle them frequently.

To create an API key head to https://runchat.app/dashboard/keys. Scroll to the bottom of the page to the Runchat API Keys section and click Create New Key. Copy the generated key and store it somewhere securely. 

All API endpoints are authenticated using the Authorization header and a Bearer token.

```json
"Authorization": `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}`
```
