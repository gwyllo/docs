## Overview

This Runchat utilizes the Tavily Search API to perform web searches. It allows specifying the search depth and optionally limiting the search to specific domains.

## Inputs

*   **query** (`string`): The search query to be executed.
*   **searchDepth** (`select`): Options are "basic" or "advanced". Determines the depth and thoroughness of the search.
*   **domains** (`string`): A comma-separated list of domains to restrict the search to (e.g., "example.com,anothersite.org"). Leave blank to search the entire web.

## Outputs

*   **response** (`object`): The JSON response from the Tavily API, typically including the original query, search results (with URLs, titles, snippets/content, scores), response time, and potentially related follow-up questions.
