description: 'Crawls websites starting from a root URL using the Tavily API.'

## Overview

This Runchat uses the Tavily API to crawl web pages starting from a given URL. It can either map out the site structure by returning URLs (`map` mode) or extract content snippets from crawled pages based on a query (`crawl` mode). Crawl depth and breadth can be controlled.

## Inputs

*   **url** (`string`): The starting URL for the crawl.
*   **maxDepth** (`number`): The maximum depth of links to follow from the starting URL.
*   **maxBreadth** (`number`): The maximum number of links to follow on each page.
*   **limit** (`number`): The maximum number of results (URLs or snippets) to return.
*   **query** (`string`): (Optional) Natural language instructions or keywords to guide the crawler, especially relevant in `crawl` mode to find specific content.
*   **mode** (`select`): Choose between "crawl" (returns content snippets matching the query) or "map" (returns only the URLs found during the crawl).

## Outputs

*   **response** (`object`): The JSON response from the Tavily API. In `map` mode, it primarily contains a list of discovered URLs. In `crawl` mode, it contains snippets of content relevant to the query from the crawled pages. Includes the base URL and response time.
