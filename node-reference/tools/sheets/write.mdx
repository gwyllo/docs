title: 'Write Sheet'
description: 'Writes data to a specific range in a Google Sheet, potentially overwriting existing data.'
---

## Overview

This Runchat writes data (formatted as a 2D array, typically via the 'Formatter' Runchat) to a specified range within a Google Sheet. Unlike "Write to New Rows", this can overwrite existing data within the specified range.

## Inputs

*   **sheetId** (`string`): The ID of the Google Sheet to write to.
*   **range** (`string`): The A1 notation of the range to write to (e.g., "Sheet1!A1:Z", "A:Z").
*   **data** (`list` of `string`): A list of JSON strings, where each string represents an object to be written. This is typically connected to the 'Formatter' Runchat.
*   **includeHeaders** (`boolean`): Parameter passed to the internal 'Formatter' to determine if headers should be included in the data written to the sheet.

## Outputs

*   **response** (`object`): The response from the Google Sheets API update operation, containing details like the number of updated rows, cells, columns, and the range updated.
