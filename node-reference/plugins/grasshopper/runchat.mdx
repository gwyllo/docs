**Input and Output Parameters**

These will be set to whatever you have published with the ⚡ in your Runchat. All data will be cast to a string. If your runchat returns a JSON object, use the `JSwan` plugin to deserialize it and grab the properties in Grasshopper.

**Load New Runchat**

You can reset the component back to its initial state (with a single `ID` parameter) to load a new runchat from the right click menu

**Clear History**

By default when you first run the component it will create a new instance (copy) of your Runchat. Every subsequent run will use that same copy and your runchat will be able to reference the previous state (e.g. using a Loop node to build chat history). If you want to reset to a new instance, click `Clear History` from the right click menu.

**Open Documentation**

You can launch the docs (this site) from the link in the right click menu.

**Create New API Key**

This will launch [runchat.app/dashboard/keys](http://runchat.app/dashboard/keys) so you can easily copy or create your API key.

**Set API Key**

Enter your API key here and click Commit Changes to save it. It will be saved as a local environment variable so you don’t need to set it again on your local PC.
