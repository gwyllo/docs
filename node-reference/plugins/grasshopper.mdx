# Getting Started:

### 1. Install Runchat for Rhino

- In rhino, run `PackageManager`
- Search for Runchat and Install it
- Restart rhino before continuing

### 2. Add a Runchat Node in Grasshopper

- Runchat will appear in the top toolbar
- You can find the Runchat node in the toolbar, or by searching for Runchat

### 3. Provide an API key

- Head to [`runchat.app`](http://runchat.app) and create an account
- Verify your account by following the link sent to your email address

**Generate an API key**

- Whilst logged into your account:
  - Proceed to [runchat.app/dashboard/keys](http://runchat.app/dashboard/keys)
  - Scroll to the bottom and under the heading `Runchat API Keys (Early Access)` press "Create New Key"
  - Copy your key to your clipboard

**Add the API key to the Runchat Node**

<Check>
  The API key is stored as a local environment variable and is not saved with
  your Grasshopper definition.
</Check>

Enter your API key in the text field that says "Set API Key"

- Right click on the Runchat Node
- In the text field that says "Set API Key" paste your key and press enter

### 4. Get the ID of your Runchat

Runchat is a node-based editor that runs in your browser. You will need to tell the Runchat grasshopper node which Runchat workflow you want to run.

To do this you'll need to provide an `id` for the Runchat.

The `id` can be extracted from a runchat workflow URL:

- For this URL: [`https://runchat.app/editor?id=f9b5e88e-3738-4b9e-9c0b-a471bcee7d0a`](https://runchat.app/editor?id=f9b5e88e-3738-4b9e-9c0b-a471bcee7d0a)
- The id is [`f9b5e88e-3738-4b9e-9c0b-a471bcee7d0a`](https://runchat.app/editor?id=f9b5e88e-3738-4b9e-9c0b-a471bcee7d0a) (everything after `id=`)

Once you connect your id to the runchat node the inputs and outputs of the node will reflect that of your Runchat workflow.

### 5. Try out some of the examples

Head to the [Examples page](/node-reference/plugins/examples) to download example grasshopper definitions and learn from their matching Runchats.

### 6. Learn how to create your own apps
