# Getting Started:

### 1. Install Runchat for Rhino

- In rhino, run `PackageManager`
- Search for Runchat and Install it
- Restart rhino before continuing

### 2. Download the examples

Head to the [Examples page](/node-reference/plugins/examples) to download example grasshopper definitions and learn from their matching Runchats. 
Or if you just want to download the grasshopper files to get started you can grab them here: 
<Info>
  Download a ZIP file of all examples here:
  <a href="https://storage.runchat.app/gh-examples.zip">GH Examples ZIP</a>
</Info>

Once you've unzipped the examples folder, open the 01_BasicDemo.gh in Grasshopper.

### 3. Link your API key and connect accounts 

You will need to create a Runchat API key to connect Grasshopper to your Runchat account. 

- Head to [`runchat.app`](http://runchat.app) and create an account or sign in
- Verify your account by following the link sent to your email address
- Whilst logged into your account:
  - Proceed to [runchat.app/dashboard/keys](http://runchat.app/dashboard/keys)
  - Scroll to the bottom and under the heading `Runchat API Keys (Early Access)` press "Create New Key"
  - Copy your key to your clipboard

Back in Grasshopper, open the 01_BasicDemo.gh file. Right-click the Runchat component and paste your API key in the text field that says "Set API Key".
Press enter to save the key. Your Runchat account is now linked and you can run the examples! Some examples need you to connect other services to 
generate images or text. Check the [Accounts page](/accounts) to learn how to set this up. 

<Check>
  The API key is stored as a local environment variable and is not saved with
  your Grasshopper definition.
</Check>

### 4. Create your own apps
