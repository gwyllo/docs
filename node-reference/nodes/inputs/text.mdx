The `text` node allows you to type or paste multiline text input. You can create lists of text by clicking the `+` button. 

Connecting an input to the `text` node will immediately cast the input to a `string` and display it in the text field.

You can reference credentials and other parameters directly into your text field. This can be useful for defining template strings where you want a user to be able to enter a variable into one specific part of the text.
