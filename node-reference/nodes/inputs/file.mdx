The `file` node allows you to import images (jpg, png or gif), documents (xml, html, csv, txt) and PDFs into Runchat. You can import multiple files by clicking the `+` button. 

When you import an image or PDF, it is uploaded to the cloud and a URI to the file is saved on the node so that it can be retrieved when needed. Plain text data is stored directly on the node. 

Runchat will automatically detect the type of the file and adjust the input and output parameters to match. You can only reference a single file type into any one `import` node. If you need to import multiple file types, use multiple nodes.

You can view a preview of the file by clicking the preview dropdown.
