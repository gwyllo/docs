# URL Input

This is the URL of the API endpoint you want to make a request to. If your API endpoint uses a url with query parameters, see this guide for [developing a tool for parametrically working with query parameters in the API node](https://www.notion.so/Making-requests-with-Query-Strings-17e2742769ce803b937ae99372a25f2a?pvs=21). 

# Method Input

The HTTP method to request on the required resource. This can be `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`. 

# Header Input

The headers to send with the request. These typically include authorization credentials and content type specifications. **Never enter API keys as text in the API header as these can be exposed to anyone with access to your Runchat**. [Instead, always use the Credentials menu to securely add API keys and credentials to your requests.](https://www.notion.so/Credentials-and-Encrypted-Keys-in-Inputs-1832742769ce8075bb33f1a6b9e7b3ed?pvs=21) 

# Body Input

The request body. This can be a string or JSON object. The exact content of the request body will typically depend on the schema of the API endpoint you are making a request to. Be sure to read the API documentation to understand how to format content in the request body. 

# Making requests with the API Node

To make a request with the API node you will typically need to: 

- Obtain an API key from the service you are making a request to and add this to your Secrets and Variables in [runchat.app/dashboard/keys](http://runchat.app/dashboard/keys)
- Check the API documentation for endpoint urls and query parameters
- Check the API documentation for header fields and how to send your credentials.
- Check the API documentation for how to format your request body

It is usually a good idea to make your first request using example data provided by most API documentation. Once this is working, substitute your own data. 

If API documentation provides example cURL commands, [you can automatically format these for the API node using Prompt formats or tools.](https://www.notion.so/Working-with-cURL-1822742769ce80999d97e41a5d01a224?pvs=21)
