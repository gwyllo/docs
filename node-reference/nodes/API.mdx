The API node enables you to make HTTP requests to external services and APIs. This node supports various HTTP methods and allows you to configure request headers, body content, and authentication.

This is the URL of the API endpoint you want to make a request to. If your API endpoint uses a url with query parameters, [you can reference them directly into the url](/concepts/data/data-referencing). 

### URL Input
The URL of the API endpoint you want to request. For endpoints that use query parameters, refer to our guide on [working with query parameters in the API node](https://www.notion.so/Making-requests-with-Query-Strings-17e2742769ce803b937ae99372a25f2a?pvs=21).

### Method Input
The HTTP method to use for the request. Supported methods include:
- `GET`: Retrieve data
- `POST`: Create new data
- `PUT`: Update existing data
- `PATCH`: Partially update data
- `DELETE`: Remove data

### Header Input
HTTP headers to include with your request. Common headers include:
- Authorization credentials
- Content-Type specifications:
  - `application/json` - For JSON data
  - `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` - For form data
  - `application/xml` - For XML data
  - `multipart/form-data` - For file uploads with text fields (experimental)
  - `text/plain` - For plain text
  - `application/octet-stream` - For binary data (images, PDFs, etc.)
- Custom API-specific headers

The headers to send with the request. These typically include authorization credentials and content type specifications. **Never enter API keys as text in the API header as these can be exposed to anyone with access to your Runchat**. [Instead, always use the Credentials menu to securely add API keys and credentials to your requests.](/concepts/integrations/credentials) 

> ℹ️ **Note on Multipart/Form-Data**
> The multipart/form-data support is currently experimental. When uploading files with text fields, note that the UX is limited as it only works with string values.

### Body Input
The request payload, which can be either a string or JSON object. The format and content of the body depend on the API's requirements. Always refer to the API documentation for the correct body structure.

## Getting Started

To make your first API request:

1. **Set up authentication**:
   - Obtain an API key from your service provider
   - Add the key to your [runchat.app/dashboard/keys](http://runchat.app/dashboard/keys)

2. **Configure your request**:
   - Review the API documentation for the correct endpoint URL
   - Verify required headers and authentication method
   - Format the request body according to the API specifications

3. **Test your request**:
   - Start with example data from the API documentation
   - Verify the response format and status codes
   - Once confirmed working, substitute with your actual data

**Pro Tip**: If the API documentation provides cURL examples, you can automatically convert them to API node format using the Request type in the [prompt output format](/node-reference/nodes/prompt).
