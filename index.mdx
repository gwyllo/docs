Runchat is a visual canvas for creating small units of software called workflows. 
Each workflow is made by connecting together three basic building blocks: 
a Prompt node for interacting with language models, an API node for making requests to external services and a Code node for running Javascript. 
Workflows can be collapsed into a single node (called a Tool) and used over and over again to build up more complex applications.
