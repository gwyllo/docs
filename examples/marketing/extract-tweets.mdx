### Inputs

`url`

The url to the blog post that you want to extract tweets from.

### Outputs

`result`

A list of JSON objects representing tweets. Each object contains a post title, post content and link to abstract image.

## Use and applications

After generating the tweet objects you could connect a social media service to runchat to post them automatically. 
You can get more creative with image generation for blog posts - we could extract the image from the blog post itself, 
use a different prompt to generate more relevant images or search the internet for something appropriate.
