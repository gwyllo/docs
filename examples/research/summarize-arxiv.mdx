### Inputs

`query`

The query to search arxiv for e.g. "generative ai"

### Outputs

`content`

A summary of findings from all collected articles

## Use and applications

This is an advanced example that demonstrates how to run api requests in a loop, accumulate them over time and scrape XML data 
to reduce context size in the prompt node. It could be customized and extended in several ways, for instance by 
providing more specific guidance on concepts the user is interested in, fetching and summarizing the full article HTML or PDF content, or running this workflow on a schedule to collect research over time.
