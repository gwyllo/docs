Runchat stores all data in structures called Data Trees. 
These allow for complex data matching when required but are typically not necessary for most ordinary use cases.

# What is a Data Tree

A data tree stores data as a list of key-value pairs called branches. 
Keys are called ‘paths’. You can think of a path as an address to some data or content in your runchat. 
Values are always an array (list) of data. 

# Why do we need them?

Data trees are useful for keeping track of operations that ‘divide’ data into smaller chunks. Say for example you write two prompts to generate image concepts (lets call these prompt 0 and prompt 1). Now say each of these generates 5 concepts (concept 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4), and you try creating 4 images for each concept (image 0, 1, 2, 3). Then, for each image, you want to generate three new images exploring different options for styles (style 0, 1 and 2). This is a pretty typical exercise in Runchat. Data trees allow us to store these stylized images in a way where we can easily associate them with the image they were generated from. For instance, if we looked at the data tree for one of our stylised images it might look something like: 

```xml
prompt1:concept3:image0:style2
```

Just from looking at the tree we can figure out where the image came from! 

# Matching Data Trees

When you provide two data trees as inputs to a node, Runchat will:

1. create a set of all paths
2. match inputs based on paths where possible
3. fallback to parent paths if matching paths are not found (e.g. 0:0 will map to 0)
