# Creating and Adding to Libraries

Any runchat you created with published parameters (âš¡) can be added to a library and used as a standalone node within any other runchat. This allows you to build powerful applications from reusable modular building blocks. For instance, you might create a runchat that formats text in a particular way, or adds styles to an image prompt, or connects to a third party API. By adding this runchat to a library, you can then access it directly from the main runchat search menu and drop it on the canvas as a single node. 

To add a runchat to an existing library or create a new one, click `Add to Library` next to the runchat you want to add, then select the library you want to add to. To create a new library, enter a new library name from the input field at the bottom of the dropdown and click `+` to create and add it. 

To remove a runchat from a library, click on the library name to show the dropdown, then click Remove from Library.

# Installing and Uninstalling Libraries

You can control which libraries appear in the runchat search menu by installing or uninstalling them. All installed libraries (both your own and any that have been created by another author) will appear on the [Libraries](https://runchat.app/dashboard/libraries) page.  To install a library, click the puzzle piece button in the corner of the library card so that it appears as a solid blue. To uninstall it, click the puzzle piece again so that it appears as an outline. When you create a new library it will automatically be installed. You can now add any node in the library from the search menu in the editor.
