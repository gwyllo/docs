# Creating a new Runchat

There are several ways to create a new runchat. 

1. Visit [runchat.app/editor?new=true](http://runchat.app/editor?new=true) to create a blank canvas
2. Click on the New button from editor toolbar

Note that creating a new runchat will overwrite any unsaved local changes you have made - so if you want to keep what you were working on remember to save it to the cloud. 

# Saving to the cloud

Runchat will save your local changes whenever you make changes to a node. 
Runchat will also automatically save after you change the name of your Runchat. 
If you have a Pro account, Runchat will also save a new version to the Runchat history whenever a node is added or removed. 

# Save History

If you have a Runchat Pro account, you can view the save history for your Runchat from the Runchat menu in the top left of the editor. 
Once you have named and saved your runchat, a copy of your runchat will be saved to the cloud every time you add or remove a node. 
Clicking on a time stamp will replace nodes in the editor with the state of the runchat at that time. 
You can add a custom label to each saved version to make it easier to return to particular states, and delete versions if you wish. 

# Privacy

All saved runchats are public by default, meaning that if someone visits the url link to your runchat they will be able to see exactly how it was made. 
This is to encourage learning and sharing. To make a runchat private and prevent other users from opening it in editor view or making copies, click Make Private from the Runchat menu in the top left of the editor. 
Private runchats can still be published as apps, shared in libraries and used as nodes in other runchats.

Toggling privacy settings requires a [Runchat Pro subscription](https://runchat.app/pricing). 

</Info>

The [dashboard](https://runchat.app/dashboard) displays a list of all runchats you have created. You can filter by names and tags using the search input at the top of the page. To add a tag to a runchat, click the `+` button in the tags column and enter a tag name. Tags are useful for organizing runchats into projects, concepts and groups.

# Loading a runchat

Click on the name of the runchat you want to load to open Editor view. You can also copy a link to the editor view by hovering the name and clicking the copy icon. To load the runchat in App view, change the url from /editor to /play, or click on Preview App from the editor menu. If you previously saved a runchat to a JSON file, you can also load it by dragging and dropping the JSON file into [runchat.app/editor](http://runchat.app/editor). 

# Deleting runchats

Hover the runchat you want to delete then click the trash icon to delete it. To delete multiple runchats, select them using the checkbox at the end of the row, then click delete from the header.
