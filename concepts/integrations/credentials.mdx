Runchat can integrate with any external service that accepts http requests. 
To make these requests securely, you can enter any sensitive data like passwords or api keys in the [Keys page](https://runchat.app/dashboard/keys) on the Runchat dashboard and then reference these using the Credentials interface in the API node. 
To add a new Key, enter a name for your variable and the sensitive data, then click Add to encrypt and store it. 


# Accessing Credentials

To display the Credentials interface, press `Tab` from within a text input field. 
This will display a list of all keys and services you have added on the dashboard, as well as some global variables like the ids of the current runchat, runchat instance and user. 
Click on the key you want to add to insert the variable into the text input. 

<Check>
You can insert placeholder tags for credentials in any text node. These will only be decrypted during the API request and cannot be returned to the editor.

# Sharing Runchats with Keys

Only the key name is ever saved or shared with the Editor or App view and the decrypted key never leaves the Runchat server. How keys are linked to accounts depends on where the Runchat is accessed: 

- When signed into Runchat, Runchat will use your credentials.
- When calling a Runchat via API, Runchat will use the credentials of the user with the matching Runchat API Key.
- If you are not signed in and are viewing a Runchat in App view, Runchat will use the authors credentials.
